# ShopPromotion

## Introduction

In the past, the streets of Spain were full of thriving local shops. However, due to the rise of Online Shops , many bussinesses are closing. Thinking about what i could do to help about the situation, i thought that having personalized promotions was difficult for local shops. Online shops have tools to create and apply promotions in seconds, due to the ability to create accounts in their apps and advertise these promotions. Local Shops relay on general promotions (2x1 in shoes, 50% in selected products...) that are difficult to advertise if customers don´t often pass by the shop. 

## Idea

Develop a Smart Contract acting as a Database for each shop´s promotions, paired with an App that makes it easier for users to interact with it.
### Advantages

- Local Shops only have to pay once to deploy the contract. No monthly or Yearly maintenance fees.
- Shops don´t have to create their own App, therefore lowering costs. Advertisement of shop offers could be displayed in the app or via mobile notifications.
- Customers only need one address for all shops using this technology, no many different cards or QR codes.
- Customers don´t even need the mobile app after creating the account, they can carry a QR in a card or papercode containing their address. 

### Disadvantages
- Depending on the chain deployed, might be very costly to update the contract
- Elderly people might get confused even if there´s only 1 simple step to create the address. And shop owners might not be familiarized at all with technology
  
## RoadMap
- Developing a simple App connected to metamask
- Polishing the app and testing it on a testchain and mobile phone
- End!!!!!!
